# Docker
In this repository I will add all the docker images that I create. In particular, the wiki section will have all the links to the docker images with an explanation of them. 
Follow bamundo (me!) on dockerHub to stay up to date.

In general, to obtain an image you need to go to my dockerHub page:
https://hub.docker.com/u/bamundo

Here you should pull the image you want (for example for qt6-debian):
docker pull bamundo/qt6-debian

Then execute the run:
docker container run -it -v "PathDirQtCode":"DestFile" bamundo/qt6-debian

You are free to use these images as you prefer.
