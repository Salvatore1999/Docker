# Docker
In this repository I will add all the docker images I will create. 

Follow bamundo (me!) on dockerHub to stay up to date.

In general, to obtain an image you need to go to my dockerHub page:
https://hub.docker.com/u/bamundo

Here you should pull the image you want (for example for qt6-debian):
docker pull bamundo/qt6-debian

Then execute the run:
docker container run -it -v "PathDirQtCode":"DestFile" bamundo/qt6-debian

You are free to use these images as you prefer.
